# kattis
In this repository I have included the problems I have solved from the Kattis website.
- All problems are solved with **Python** language.
- Most of these problems have low scores and are classified as **simple and moderate** problems.
- These solutions are **definitely not the best solutions** and you can challenge yourself by writing better and more efficient code.

## What is Kattis?
- Kattis helps companies to recruit and attract the best programmers with its dynamic challenge platform.
- With Kattis companies can challenge developers before letting them enter the recruitment process saving time. Kattis can also be used to add code challenges to job-pages or for quality tests later in the recruitment process. By using Kattis code challenges everyone gets an equal chance and companies brand themselves as an equal opportunity workplace.
- Kattis is also used in the world championships in programming(ICPC) and several other competitions all over the globe.
